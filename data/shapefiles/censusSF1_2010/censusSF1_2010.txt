  Description:
    Abstract: Selected housing and population indicators derived from the "2010 Census Summary File 1" published by the U.S. Census Bureau, summarized on a census block basis.  All indicators have numerators and denominators except in cases of total population counts and averages. Numerators are denoted with "_N" and Denominators with "_D".
    Purpose: Demographic analysis and visualization.  Users are strongly advised to thoroughly read this metadata record and 2010 Summary File 1 documentation available from the U.S. Census Bureau at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf.  A copy of this technical documentation is included with the data download file available from RIGIS.
